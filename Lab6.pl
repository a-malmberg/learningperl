#(+30) Write a python program per the following specifications:
#1.	Populate an array(list) of size 50 randomly with only integers 0 and 1 
#2.	Repeat step1  n = 1000 times using either a while loop or a for loop 
#At this point you should have a total of 50000 observations  
#3.	Display the number of 0’s 	(use the count() function from prior labs) 
#4.	Display the number of 1’s 	(use the count() function from prior labs)
#5.	Using the Binomial distribution formulas 
#a.	Display the expected mean (average) of the 1’s  
#b.	 Calculate and display the standard deviation (SD) 
#NOTE: sd should be  > 100
#c.	Display the range as follows:   mean + SD  mean - SD
#6.	Answer the question:  is the total number of 1’s from 4 above. within the range as calculated in 5.c by printing 
#		‘Yes’ if it is within the range calculated in 5c 
#		‘No’   if it is not
