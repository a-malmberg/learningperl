# (+20) Write a python program that generates four random  between  -50 and  +50 using pythonâ€™s  random number generator  (RNG)  see the following code (modify as needed )
# import random
# a = 10
# b =100
# x = random.randint(a,b) # (1) returns an integer a <= x <= b
# modify a and b accordingly
# print('random integer == ', x) 
# your code will require 4 statements similar to (1) above

#and displays 
#1.	the four integers
#2.	The maximum integer
#3.	The minimum integer
#4.	The number of even integers  (if x %2 == 0 then x is even)
#5.	The number of odd integers
#6.	The number of integers greater than 0 but less than 50  
#7.	The number of positive integers
#8.	The number of negative integers 
#9.	The average of the smallest and largest integers 
#10.	The average of all four integers 

#EXAMPLE OUTPUT
#If the RNG generated the four integers  22  -8  17  -5 then display 
#1.	The integers are 22  -8  17  -5
#2.	The maximum integer is 22
#3.	The minimum integer is -8
#4.	The number of even integers  is  2 
#5.	The number of odd integers is  2
#6.	The number of integers greater than 0 but less than 50 is 2
#7.	The number of positive integers  2
#8.	The number of negative integers   2 
#9.	The average of the smallest and largest integers  7.0  
#10.	The average of the four integers is 6.5
