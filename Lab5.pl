#(+30) Provide a python program which will 
#1.	Populate an array(list) of size 25 with integers in the range -100 (negative 100)   to  +100 inclusive
#2.	Display the array and its length (use the len function) 
#3.	Display the average of all the integers in the array
#4.	Display the number of even integers  (how many)
#5.	Display the number of odd integers  (how many) 
#6.	Display the number of integers > 0   (how many)
#7.	Display the number of integers < 0   (how many) 
#8.	Display the median.  
#NOTE  In sorted order, the median equals the 13th == array[12] element in the array.  Please do not use array[12] to display the median instead consider n/2 or n//2 or a ceil or #floor functions  etc.  That is the median should be calculated using  n 
#9.	Display the integers >= median   (See the : operator as in sub = array[2:6]  know  splice  )
#10.	Display the integers  <  median see the splice operator 
#11.	Ask the user for an integer and print the number of times the integer is in the array 
#HINT: see the count function below
#12.	 Display the maximum integer
#13.	Display the minimum integer
#14.	Display the array in reverse sorted order (largest to smallest) See the sort() and reverse() functions 
#15.	Display the gcd of the largest and smallest integers  (See the lesson for an example ) using pythonâ€™s gcd function
